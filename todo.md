Lest I forget, here lie some goals.

- Clean up everything, it's a tad unorganized.
- Make configs for VPS, servers.
- Look at [Linux Hardening](https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html).
- Read-only dconf.
- Read-only/overlay home dir.
- A way to share secrets protected by hardware tokens.
- Look at containerization, gVisor, crosvm, etc.
